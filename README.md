# BattleBoatGame
Made by Tanya Sankhla

The "Battle Boat" is a boat that the user must find and sink. 
The user has their own boat with a limited number of torpedoes that can be fired at locations where the Battle Boat is assumed to be. If the user hits the Battle Boat with a torpedo, they win. 
If they expend all of their torpedoes before hitting the Battle boat, they lose.
